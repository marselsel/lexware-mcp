# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.1]

### Added
- Advertised MCP server version bumped to **0.1.1** — reflects the expanded tool surface
  (41 → 65 tools) and the read-modify-write update tools; the version change also nudges MCP
  clients to refresh a stale cached tool list (e.g. so `update-contact`/`create-contact`
  pick up the `addresses` and `company.vatRegistrationId`/`taxNumber`/`allowTaxFreeInvoices` fields).
- **Files & PDF (binary) support** — the client now speaks binary, not just JSON:
  - `download-file` (GET a stored file) and document `render-<type>-pdf`
    (invoice/quotation/credit-note/delivery-note: render via `/document`, then download)
    return the bytes inline as MCP embedded resources.
  - `upload-file` and `upload-voucher-file` send `multipart/form-data` (file as base64 in).
- **Bookkeeping vouchers** — `create-voucher`, `update-voucher`, and `upload-voucher-file`
  (attach a receipt) for manually-booked sales/purchase transactions.
- **Document draft-updates** — `update-draft-<type>` for the six writable document types
  (optimistic locking via `version`).
- `list-recurring-templates` (read) and `delete-article` (finalize tier, destructive).
- Two new `LexwareClient` methods — `getBinary` and `postMultipart` — sharing the existing
  rate-limit/retry transport; multipart deliberately omits `Content-Type` (fetch derives the boundary).

### Added — initial release
- Initial open-source release of the Lexware Office MCP server (Skybridge MCP App) —
  a remote/hosted, OAuth-capable connector for the Claude app, claude.ai web, and ChatGPT.
- **Tiered tools** across read / draft / finalize:
  - **Read** (always on): profile; contacts & articles (list/get); voucherlist; full
    documents (invoices, quotations, credit notes, order confirmations, delivery notes,
    dunnings, down-payment invoices, vouchers); payments; reference data (countries,
    payment conditions, posting categories, print layouts); recurring templates; event
    subscriptions; document deeplinks.
  - **Drafts/writes** (`LEXWARE_ENABLE_DRAFTS`, on): create draft invoices/quotations/
    credit-notes/order-confirmations/delivery-notes/dunnings; create & update contacts and
    articles (optimistic locking); create event subscriptions.
  - **Finalize** (`LEXWARE_ENABLE_FINALIZE`, off): issue legally-binding finalized
    documents (confirmation-gated); irreversible deletes (e.g. delete event subscriptions).
- Authentication on `/mcp`, fail-closed, in two modes:
  - **Static bearer token** (`MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`) for Claude Code/Desktop.
  - **OAuth 2.1** (`OAUTH_ISSUER`, …) via any provider (e.g. WorkOS AuthKit) — exposes
    `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`, validates JWT access tokens against the
    provider's JWKS, and optionally restricts `OAUTH_ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS` (enforced
    server-side). Enables use as a custom connector in the Claude app and on claude.ai web.
- `~2 req/s` rate limiting with 429/`Retry-After` backoff, and capability tiers via env flags.
- Docker image, `docker-compose.yml`, Cloud Run guide, CI, and tests.

### Known limitations
- A few write shapes are typed leniently and carry `VERIFY` notes pending confirmation
  against live data: bookkeeping-voucher fields, the file-upload `type` field, and whether
  document draft-updates use optimistic-locking `version`. Wrong guesses surface as a clean
  4xx (`LexwareApiError`), never silent data loss.
- `render-<type>-pdf` is wired for invoice/quotation/credit-note/delivery-note; dunning,
  order-confirmation, and down-payment rendering await a read-only live check of `/document`.
